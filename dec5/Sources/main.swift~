// Solve by making an array of linked-lists, where each element in the array
// points to the head of the stack. Read the input, line by line, and 
// rearrange the array of linked lists accordingly.

/*
When reading `move 2 from 5 to 9` split the line by whitespaces. Try to parse
all elements as integers, if parse is successfull append element into a
new array. If the new array has a count of 3, make the following mapping in 
a tuple `(move: $0, from: $1, to: $2)`
*/

/*
when reading first part of the input to program the stacks, start by reading
the entire input line by line, into a parsing array, until a line, only
containing a newline is encountered.

Then record the indices of the numbers in the last read line. These indices
will be used to check whether or not a create is present in a given stack.

Reverse the read lines and rebuild the stack, line by line, by checking for
valid inputs at the indices previously recorded.
